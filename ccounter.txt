'''
create program to track calories eaten.  this is something that I already do but re-doing the macros (%fat / %carb / %protein)
each time I eat something different is getting to be tedious.
I realize there are plenty of applications out there that already do this, but the process seemed simple enough that I could
make my own relatively quickly.

phase 1: framework
	- input is a file where each line is a food item in a small unit with nutrition facts
	- print out calculations, probably just to console for now
phase 2: foundation
	- consider importing free database of lots of foods and working with that
phase 3: flair
	- GUI with dropdowns, etc.

f = open('item2.txt','r')

temp = []
for line in f:
	temp = [x.strip() for x in line.split(',')]
	print(temp)
	# how to make each object have its name as an identifier?  ...sounds like a primary key of a database!

class food:
	def __init__(self, fullitem):
		self.name = fullitem[0]
		self.quantity = float(fullitem[1])
		self.unit = fullitem[2]
		self.fat = float(fullitem[3])
		self.carb = float(fullitem[4])
		self.protein = float(fullitem[5])
		self.calories = float(fullitem[6])
